# Atlesium_Frontend

We all know Intercom, Drift, and all of the other customer relationship platforms. But honestly, those platforms don’t allow you to get a real sense of your visitor. What’s more effective than text? Video. Atlesium introduces a new take on customer relationships and allows you the owner to connect with your visitors on a more personal level. 

Atlesium is very easy to use. After you create a video on Atlesium, a tag is then given to you. You then insert the tag into the index.html of your website and specify which HTML div you want it to appear in. The modal that comes up is called a Retican and so far there are four reticans available: Introductory, Video Response, Text Response, General. 

In addition, you can also receive analytics on your reticans and video/text responses from your visitors. 

The architecture consists of two microservices dedicated to video and image compression. Additionally, there are two other microservices that are used for server side rendering and server/data handling. What you're seeing right now is the frontend code for Atlesium that uses the React framework.
